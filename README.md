# Introduction to Machine Learning Using Python

Welcome to the **Introduction to Machine Learning using Python** project! This repository showcases how to build a machine learning model from scratch using Python, starting with data exploration and preprocessing, and going through to training and evaluating models. 

This project leverages a dataset from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu), and walks you through the essential steps for building and applying machine learning models.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates several steps of machine learning development, including:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for model training.
- **Model Selection**: Choosing the appropriate machine learning algorithms.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Training models and evaluating their performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Graphically representing the data and results.

### Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu). You will need to download the dataset from the repository and ensure it is accessible to the project. Clear instructions on how to load and use the dataset are provided within the project's codebase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `jupyter`

You can install all dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

To avoid dependency conflicts, it is recommended that you use a virtual environment. You can set one up as follows:

1. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Project

1. **Jupyter Notebooks**:
   The project contains Jupyter notebooks that provide a step-by-step guide for data analysis, model building, and evaluation. You can launch the Jupyter environment by running:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Navigate to the relevant notebook files to explore the data, build machine learning models, and visualize the results.

2. **Python Scripts**:
   For those who prefer Python scripts over notebooks, you can also run individual Python files that handle different parts of the machine learning pipeline. For example:

   ```bash
   python src/preprocessing.py
   python src/models.py
   ```

### Machine Learning Models

This project implements several machine learning models, including but not limited to:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**

Each model is evaluated and compared using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and more. Visualizations are provided to aid in understanding the performance of each model.

## Next Steps

After running the example models, you are encouraged to:

- Experiment with different machine learning models.
- Tweak hyperparameters to improve performance.
- Apply additional evaluation metrics or perform cross-validation.
- Add new datasets or extend the functionality to include deep learning models.
